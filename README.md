# Automatic-gas-leakage-detection-system
The project uses a gas sensor module and an Arduino Uno board to detect the presence of flammable gases like propane, butane, and methane. When the gas concentration exceeds a certain threshold, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino, which triggers an alarm to alert the user.
